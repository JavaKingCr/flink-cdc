# Using Flink CDC to synchronize data from MySQL sharding tables and build real-time data lake

For OLTP databases, to deal with a huge number of data in a single table, we usually do database and table sharding to get better throughput.
But sometimes, for convenient analysis, we need to merge them into one table when loading them to data warehouse or data lake.

This tutorial will show how to use Flink CDC to build a real-time data lake for such a scenario.
You can walk through the tutorial easily in the docker environment. The entire process uses standard SQL syntax without a single line of Java/Scala code or IDE installation.

The following sections will take the pipeline from MySQL to [Iceberg](https://iceberg.apache.org/) as an example. The overview of the architecture is as follows:

![Real-time data lake with Flink CDC](/_static/fig/real-time-data-lake-tutorial/real-time-data-lake-tutorial.png "architecture of real-time data lake")

You can also use other data sources like Oracle/Postgres and sinks like Hudi to build your own pipeline.

## Preparation
Prepare a Linux or MacOS computer with Docker installed.

### Starting components required
The components required in this tutorial are all managed in containers, so we will use `docker-compose` to start them.

Create `docker-compose.yml` file using following contents:
```
version: '2.1'
services:
  sql-client:
    user: flink:flink
    image: yuxialuo/flink-sql-client:1.13.2.v1 
    depends_on:
      - jobmanager
      - mysql
    environment:
      FLINK_JOBMANAGER_HOST: jobmanager
      MYSQL_HOST: mysql
    volumes:
      - shared-tmpfs:/tmp/iceberg
  jobmanager:
    user: flink:flink
    image: flink:1.13.2-scala_2.11
    ports:
      - "8081:8081"
    command: jobmanager
    environment:
      - |
        FLINK_PROPERTIES=
        jobmanager.rpc.address: jobmanager
    volumes:
      - shared-tmpfs:/tmp/iceberg
  taskmanager:
    user: flink:flink
    image: flink:1.13.2-scala_2.11
    depends_on:
      - jobmanager
    command: taskmanager
    environment:
      - |
        FLINK_PROPERTIES=
        jobmanager.rpc.address: jobmanager
        taskmanager.numberOfTaskSlots: 2
    volumes:
      - shared-tmpfs:/tmp/iceberg
  mysql:
    image: debezium/example-mysql:1.1
    ports:
      - "3306:3306"
    environment:
      - MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=123456
      - MYSQL_USER=mysqluser
      - MYSQL_PASSWORD=mysqlpw

volumes:
  shared-tmpfs:
    driver: local
    driver_opts:
      type: "tmpfs"
      device: "tmpfs"
```

The Docker Compose environment consists of the following containers:
- SQL-Client: Flink SQL Client, used to submit queries and visualize their results.
- Flink Cluster: a Flink JobManager and a Flink TaskManager container to execute queries.
- MySQL: mainly used as a data source to store the sharding table.

***Note:***
1. To simply this tutorial, the jar packages required has been packaged into the SQL-Client container. You can see how it's built in [GitHub](https://github.com/luoyuxia/flink-cdc-tutorial/tree/main/flink-cdc-iceberg-demo/sql-client). 
If you want to run with your own Flink environment, remember to download the following packages and then put them to `FLINK_HOME/lib/`.
   
   **Download links are available only for stable releases, SNAPSHOT dependency need build by yourself. **
   - [flink-sql-connector-mysql-cdc-2.3-SNAPSHOT.jar](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/ververica/flink-sql-connector-mysql-cdc/2.3-SNAPSHOT/flink-sql-connector-mysql-cdc-2.3-SNAPSHOT.jar)
   - [flink-shaded-hadoop-2-uber-2.7.5-10.0.jar](https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/org/apache/flink/flink-shaded-hadoop-2-uber/2.7.5-10.0/flink-shaded-hadoop-2-uber-2.7.5-10.0.jar)
   - [iceberg-flink-1.13-runtime-0.13.0-SNAPSHOT.jar](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/luoyuxia/flink-cdc-tutorial/main/flink-cdc-iceberg-demo/sql-client/lib/iceberg-flink-1.13-runtime-0.13.0-SNAPSHOT.jar)
   
   Currently, the Iceberg official `iceberg-flink-runtime` jar that supports Flink 1.13 isn't released. 
   Here, we provide a `iceberg-flink-runtime` jar supporting Flink 1.13, which is built based on the master branch of Iceberg. 
   You can download the `iceberg-flink-runtime` jar from the [apache official repository](https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/org/apache/iceberg/iceberg-flink-runtime/) once Iceberg 0.13.0 is released.
2. All the following commands involving `docker-compose` should be executed in the directory of the `docker-compose.yml` file.

To start all containers, run the following command in the directory that contains the `docker-compose.yml` file:
```shell
docker-compose up -d
```
This command automatically starts all the containers defined in the Docker Compose configuration in a detached mode. Run `docker ps` to check whether these containers are running properly.
We can also visit [http://localhost:8081/](http://localhost:8081/) to see if Flink is running normally.

### Preparing data in databases
1. Enter mysql's container:
    ```shell
    docker-compose exec mysql mysql -uroot -p123456
    ```
2. Create databases/tables and populate data:

   Create a logical sharding table `user` sharded in different databases and tables physically.
   ```sql
    CREATE DATABASE db_1;
    USE db_1;
    CREATE TABLE user_1 (
      id INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
      name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'flink',
      address VARCHAR(1024),
      phone_number VARCHAR(512),
      email VARCHAR(255)
    );
    INSERT INTO user_1 VALUES (110,"user_110","Shanghai","123567891234","user_110@foo.com");
   
    CREATE TABLE user_2 (
      id INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
      name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'flink',
      address VARCHAR(1024),
      phone_number VARCHAR(512),
      email VARCHAR(255)
    );
   INSERT INTO user_2 VALUES (120,"user_120","Shanghai","123567891234","user_120@foo.com");
   ```
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE db_2;
   USE db_2;
   CREATE TABLE user_1 (
     id INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
     name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'flink',
     address VARCHAR(1024),
     phone_number VARCHAR(512),
     email VARCHAR(255)
   );
   INSERT INTO user_1 VALUES (110,"user_110","Shanghai","123567891234", NULL);

   CREATE TABLE user_2 (
     id INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
     name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'flink',
     address VARCHAR(1024),
     phone_number VARCHAR(512),
     email VARCHAR(255)
   );
   INSERT INTO user_2 VALUES (220,"user_220","Shanghai","123567891234","user_220@foo.com");
   ```

## Creating tables using Flink DDL in Flink SQL CLI
First, use the following command to enter the Flink SQL CLI Container:
```shell
docker-compose exec sql-client ./sql-client
```

We should see the welcome screen of the CLI client:

![Flink SQL Client](/_static/fig/real-time-data-lake-tutorial/flink-sql-client.png  "Flink SQL Client" )

Then do the following steps in Flink SQL CLI:

1. Enable checkpoints every 3 seconds
   
   Checkpoint is disabled by default, we need to enable it to commit Iceberg transactions.
   Besides, the beginning of mysql-cdc binlog phase also requires waiting a complete checkpoint to avoid disorder of binlog records.
   ```sql
   -- Flink SQL                   
   Flink SQL> SET execution.checkpointing.interval = 3s;
   ```
2. Create MySQL sharding source table 

   Create a source table that captures the data from the logical sharding table `user`. Here, we use regex to match all the physical tables.
   Besides, the table defines metadata column to identify which database/table the record comes from.
   ```sql
   -- Flink SQL
   Flink SQL> CREATE TABLE user_source (
       database_name STRING METADATA VIRTUAL,
       table_name STRING METADATA VIRTUAL,
       `id` DECIMAL(20, 0) NOT NULL,
       name STRING,
       address STRING,
       phone_number STRING,
       email STRING,
       PRIMARY KEY (`id`) NOT ENFORCED
     ) WITH (
       'connector' = 'mysql-cdc',
       'hostname' = 'mysql',
       'port' = '3306',
       'username' = 'root',
       'password' = '123456',
       'database-name' = 'db_[0-9]+',
       'table-name' = 'user_[0-9]+'
     );
   ```
3. Create Iceberg sink table

   Create a sink table `all_users_sink` used to load data to Iceberg.
   We define `database_name`, `table_name` and `id` as a combined primary key, because `id` maybe not unique across different databases and tables.
   ```sql
   -- Flink SQL
   Flink SQL> CREATE TABLE all_users_sink (
       database_name STRING,
       table_name    STRING,
       `id`          DECIMAL(20, 0) NOT NULL,
       name          STRING,
       address       STRING,
       phone_number  STRING,
       email         STRING,
       PRIMARY KEY (database_name, table_name, `id`) NOT ENFORCED
     ) WITH (
       'connector'='iceberg',
       'catalog-name'='iceberg_catalog',
       'catalog-type'='hadoop',  
       'warehouse'='file:///tmp/iceberg/warehouse',
       'format-version'='2'
     );
   ```

## Streaming to Iceberg
1. Streaming write data from MySQL to Iceberg using the following Flink SQL:
   ```sql
   -- Flink SQL
   Flink SQL> INSERT INTO all_users_sink select * from user_source;
   ```
   It will start a streaming job which will synchronize historical and incremental data from MySQL to Iceberg continuously.
   The running job can be found in [Flink UI](http://localhost:8081/#/job/running), and it looks like:
   
   
   ![CDC to Iceberg Running Job](/_static/fig/real-time-data-lake-tutorial/flink-cdc-iceberg-running-job.png "CDC to Iceberg Running Job")
   
   Then, we can use the following command to see the files written to Iceberg: 
   ```shell
   docker-compose exec sql-client tree /tmp/iceberg/warehouse/default_database/
   ```
   It should look like:

   ![Files in Iceberg](/_static/fig/real-time-data-lake-tutorial/files-in-iceberg.png "Files in Iceberg")

   The actual files may differ in your environment, but the structure of the directory should be similar.

2. Use the following Flink SQL to query the data written to `all_users_sink`:
   ```sql
   -- Flink SQL
   Flink SQL> SELECT * FROM all_users_sink;
   ```
   We can see the data queried in the Flink SQL CLI:
   
   ![Data in Iceberg](/_static/fig/real-time-data-lake-tutorial/data_in_iceberg.png "Data in Iceberg")
   
3. Make some changes in the MySQL databases, and then the data in Iceberg table `all_users_sink` will also change in real time.
   
   (3.1) Insert a new user in table `db_1.user_1`
   ```sql
   --- db_1
   INSERT INTO db_1.user_1 VALUES (111,"user_111","Shanghai","123567891234","user_111@foo.com");
   ```

   (3.2) Update a user in table `db_1.user_2`
   ```sql
   --- db_1
   UPDATE db_1.user_2 SET address='Beijing' WHERE id=120;
   ```

   (3.3) Delete a user in table `db_2.user_2`
   ```sql
   --- db_2
   DELETE FROM db_2.user_2 WHERE id=220;
   ```

   After executing each step, we can query the table `all_users_sink` using `SELECT * FROM all_users_sink` in Flink SQL CLI to see the changes.
   
   The final query result is as follows:
   
   ![Final Data in Iceberg](/_static/fig/real-time-data-lake-tutorial/final-data-in-iceberg.png "Final Data in Iceberg")

   From the latest result in Iceberg, we can see that there is a new record of `(db_1, user_1, 111)`, and the address of `(db_1, user_2, 120)` has been updated to `Beijing`.
   Besides, the record of `(db_2, user_2, 220)` has been deleted. The result is exactly the same with the changes we did in MySQL.
   
## Clean up
After finishing the tutorial, run the following command in the directory of `docker-compose.yml` to stop all containers:
```shell
docker-compose down
```
