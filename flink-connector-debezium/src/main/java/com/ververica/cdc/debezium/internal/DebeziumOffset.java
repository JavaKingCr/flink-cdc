/**
 * The state that the Flink Debezium Consumer holds for each instance.
 *
 * <p>This class describes the most basic state that Debezium used for recovering based on Kafka
 * Connect mechanism. It includes a sourcePartition and sourceOffset.
 *
 * <p>The sourcePartition represents a single input sourcePartition that the record came from (e.g.
 * a filename, table name, or topic-partition). The sourceOffset represents a position in that
 * sourcePartition which can be used to resume consumption of data.
 *
 * <p>These values can have arbitrary structure and should be represented using
 * org.apache.kafka.connect.data objects (or primitive values). For example, a database connector
 * might specify the sourcePartition as a record containing { "db": "database_name", "table":
 * "table_name"} and the sourceOffset as a Long containing the timestamp of the row.
